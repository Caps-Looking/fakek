## Pull Request Best Practices
- Ensure your solution has been unit tested, if for some reason the solution doesn't require new unit tests please point
that out in the pull request.
- All of our public facing classes, functions, and properties must be documented. If you are unsure about documenting the
code feel free to ask, we're happy to help.
- Use one of our templates, appending `template=enhancement_pull_request_template.md` or `template=bug_pull_request_template.md`
to your pull request URL and refreshing the page should populate with the template. Alternatively you can copy and paste
the contents from one of the templates found at `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/`. 
- Don't let these best practices prevent your from opening a pull request. If you are unsure about anything or have general
questions, feel free to open a draft pull request, and we'll help you out.
